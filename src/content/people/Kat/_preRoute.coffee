    -- Alkenia's market was a crowded place, stalls buying and selling almost every imaginable good. Though, Natalie noted, the prices were often somewhat inflated compared to what one would pay in Vailia itself. She had never before had enough money to consider most of the items on sale, or at least not had the intention to spend that much money. She was too busy saving up for her grand adventure. Now, though... now she could sample whatever she liked and call it a business expense. A merchant had to know what, exactly, they were selling, after all!

  ||
    -- The aroma of a spice rack drew her irresistibly towards it. Most of the scents she could at least identify, but not one that stood out.

  ||
    --> <q>Sin-namon. You're smelling sin-namon,</q> the merchant smiled at her twitching nose. <q>Special import. I hear tell it comes from beyond Kantis, north and east so far I didn't even recognize the name of the place. Amazing, isn't it?</q>

  ||
    #{@Natalie.image 'normal', 'left'}

  ||
    -- #{q}Tree bark. Boil it or grind it up. 10 obols an ounce, but a little goes a long way. Limited supplies.</q> He gestured to a single, half empty crate behind him.

  ||
    --> Natalie whistled at that. Truly it must come from halfway around the world to warrant that price – or he was a con artist, and a splendid one. The smell though - she'd never scented anything like it in her life, nor heard of it. A cargo hold full of that and she'd be set for life. #{q}Interesting. Does it taste like it smells? I might consider...</q>

  ||
    -- A flash of movement caught her eye, and a sudden feeling of a breeze. She patted her pocket, and found no bundle of coins. She spun on her heels, catching another flash of motion: a young woman, disappearing into the crowd.

  ||
    #{@Natalie.image 'upset', 'left'}
    --> #{q}Pickpocket!</q> Natalie shouted. Heads turned, a path cleared, but too late. The girl was gone, lost somewhere in the crowd.

  ||
    #{@Natalie.image 'serious', 'left'}
    --> Natalie stopped, shook her head in dismay, assessed the situation. It wasn't much money, all told, but still... She shook her head. She was getting careless, to let someone lift off her.
