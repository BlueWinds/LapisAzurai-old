      By the time she was dressed, the storm loomed almost overhead, howling winds whipping the water into a dark purple froth. Rain sleeted around them, drenching the deck and making everything slippery. The crew was already hard at work, battening everything down for a blow. She found James at the helm, pushed him aside and took the wheel herself.

      Two sailors snapped to the end of their safety lines, saved by the rope anchoring them to their posts, while the rest remained on their feet. This one hadn't risen high enough to flood over the poop deck, but it was just a warm up. Looking deeper into the storm from their position at the top of the wave, they could see even more monstrous waves coming toward them. Natalie spun the wheel, hoping desperately that the ship would turn fast enough to take the next head-on.

      Storms like this swept across the world, leaving nothing but wreckage in their wake. Refuges like Mt. Julia were vital for any ships to survive at all. Seagoing vessels existed as fugitives, darting between safe ports in the intervening lulls. No captain set sail in anything except perfect weather, to reduce their chances of getting caught in one. Like they had. And even still, as often as not, ships were unlucky. Like they were.

      Another wave towered over them, a tremendous mountain in the ocean. James managed to wrap a rope around Natalie's waist and tie it to the wheel just in time. This one didn't spill over the deck as more than a plume of spray, but surging water and gusting wind spun the ship around like a cork, and the deck tilted precipitously.

      James shouted something at her, but Natalie couldn't hear what he said, drowned out by howling wind that hit them like an almost solid object. He pointed. #{@sailor} hung limply from #{his} line, blood running from #{his} forehead. Natalie shook her head, made a sharp gesture of denial – James shouldn't go down there. He gritted his teeth and ignored her, untied his line and ran down the stairs.</text>
  </page>
  <page bg="Ship.storm">
    <text>
      This was the sort of storm that left no survivors. A Grandmother Storm. The last had been just a month ago – Natalie had helped comb the beach for wreckage and survivors in its wake. There were precious few of the latter, and far too much of the former.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page>
    <text continue>
      A wave towered over them, reaching halfway up the main mast for a brief moment before it crashed over the deck. Natalie clung to the wheel, fighting the maelstrom that tried to tear her away from her post. The Azurai popped out of the water on the other side, creaking timbers audible even over the sound of the wind. She checked the deck. James clung to one of the masts, holding #{@sailor} in one arm.</text>
  </page>
  <page>
    <text>
      Against all odds, she felt giddy, alive. Death was so close, and yet... and yet, it wouldn't claim them. She could feel it in her bones, taste it in the wind, smell it in the salt spray. Natalie felt the storm as though it were an extension of her own body, felt the howling power that fed it, felt a hundred miles of terrible elemental force seeking release...

      James looked up at the wheel – Natalie hung onto it, dazed, looking more like a drowned rat than his best friend. In the brief lull between waves, he saw... he rubbed his eyes. She was grinning like a madwoman. #{@sailor} stirred in his arms.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page bg="Ship.cabinStorm">
    <text continue>
      He cut away #{his} rope with a knife and dashed towards the door below decks, slamming it behind him just as another wall of water crashed over the ship. He leaned down, examined #{@sailor}'s forehead. Still breathing. Just a crack on the head. #{He}'d be fine.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page bg="Ship.deckStorm">
    <text>
      James pushed back into the storm, wind instantly cutting away any semblance of warmth he'd gathered inside. Clinging to the rail for stability against the violently pitching deck, he pushed his way back up to the poop deck. Natalie hadn't moved – she still clung to the wheel, grinning madly. He grabbed her shoulder, shouted something even he couldn't hear.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page>
    <text>
      #{q @Nat}Do you know why they gave me a ship, James? I'm smart, and I'm pretty, but that's not why.</q> Her voice somehow cut through the wind, though he could barely hear his own shouting. He shook his head. This wasn't the time for that.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page>
    <text continue>
      #{q}They gave me a ship because I'm not going to die!</q> She let go of the wheel with one hand, gripped his shoulder with manic strength. Another wave crashed over the ship, burying them both in boiling, freezing foam for a moment. When it cleared, one of the sails had ripped away, floating in the ocean nearby, but the mast itself was still intact.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page>
    <text>
      James shook his head again, trying to clear it. That they hadn't sunk yet was nearly a miracle. Whatever manic state had come over her, Natalie was still alive, and still holding the wheel, turning as best she could to face each new assault from the storm. In a brief lull in the wind, he heard someone below shouting to get buckets and head below decks. He clasped her shoulder again and headed off to help.

      James clung to the railing, shivering, and trying not to pass out from the twin pangs of exhaustion and chill. But he was alive – they were all alive, by some miracle. The sea still rolled, waves still occasionally rose high enough to spray the deck, but it was clear they'd passed through the worst of the storm. Light grew on the horizon – dawn, slowly pressing its way through the clouds overhead.
    </text>

  <page>
    <text>
      He stumbled to his feet, slipped on a loose rope, steadied himself with an arm on the railing. Deep weariness penetrated all the way to his bones, sapping every ounce of strength. Just a little more. He dragged himself across the deck, slapping #{@sailor} on the back where #{he} doggedly passed on pails of water handed up from below decks.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page>
    <text>
      Up on the poop deck he found Natalie, passed out and still tied to the wheel.  Numb fingers fumbled with the rope, then he bypassed them by using a knife to cut her free. They had plenty of rope. He winced away from the contact – unlike his own icy skin, she was burning hot to the touch, as if wracked by a terrible fever. Only the strength and steadiness of her breaths reassured him she wasn't on death's doorstep.

      He carried her down below decks, to her cabin. Against all odds, the interior was still dry – even a Grandmother Storm that had snapped both masts and torn away every sail hadn't been a match for the rubber seal around the door to the captain's cabin.
    </text>
  </page>
  <page>
    <text continue>
      Efficiently he stripped her, all the way down to bare skin. Any other time he would have hesitated, or at the very least been blushing and mortified as he worked, but not now – any feelings beyond mere practicality were gone, washed away somewhere in the last six hours.

      Natalie looked exactly as she had yesterday, cheerful cheeks the perfect picture of health, chest rising and falling steadily.

      Natalie jerked awake, pulse pounding. The ship... the ship was safe, rocking gently beneath her. Instinctively she reached out, feeling fractures and weak points... and winced back, mind burning.
