      In the evenings, while a pair of lookouts kept watch, most of the crew gathered on-deck to share stories and drinks and company amid the stars. Natalie made a point of leaning against the same rail as #{Math.choice g.crew}. The ocean lapped against the hull somewhere below, mild waves gently rocking the Lapis Azurai. They talked for some time, content to watch the others from a distance, letting bonds deepen with the setting of the sun.

      With colder weather setting in, those not on duty preferred to gather in the cargo hold, if it was empty enough, or squeeze into the sleeping area if not. Hot and crowded was better than windy and chill, and those too near the doorway still kept cloaks on to protect against stray drafts.

      Though she often preferred to keep her own company, or entertain a smaller group in her own quarters, Natalie also made it a point to spend plenty of time mingling with the crew, especially when off duty. Aside from the purely practical considerations of keeping in touch with their mood and fostering a sense of companionship, she also found it fascinating to listen to them â€“ why they left their homes to risk lives on the open ocean, what they wanted, who they wanted to be... - she spent hours listening to and talking with #{Math.choice g.crew}.

      As often as not it had rained in the evenings recently, so those not on watch found themselves crammed into the sleeping quarters. The humidity made the confines not entirely comfortable, but at least they could easily regulate temperature, between body heat and frozen rain outside.

    -->
      Tonight the crew played music, rather than talk, rain beating a staccato counterpoint on the deck overhead. A beat up old guitar was passed around, everyone who knew how to play it, taking turns until it finally made its way into #{@sailor}'s hands. #{He} was the best, and everyone knew it, strong and clear #{if @sailor.gender is 'f' then 'alto' else 'baritone'} voice filling the space.

      Sitting side by side on the top bunk, Natalie and #{@sailor2}, relaxed, and it wasn't long before a drowsy captain was leaning on her sailor, lulled by the soothing tones and a sad song of home-far-away. #{@sailor2} gently shifted her to lean against the wall instead, and covered her with a blanket when the song ended.

      Some evenings, once most of the day's work was done, rather than lay about and rest or play music, the crew decided to be a little more energetic. Tossing items around wasn't entirely practical on a small ship, but wrestling or running games were entirely too popular. Natalie hadn't intended to participate, but she couldn't resist when #{@sailor} bowled her over on the way to one of the goals.

      Wrapping both arms around #{@sailor}'s thigh she clung on like a burr, hanging from #{his} leg and slowing #{him} down enough for the other team to catch up. Together Natalie and #{@sailor2} wrestled away control of the colored strip of cloth that was the aim, and #{@sailor} fled back to the other side of the ship. Natalie stuck her tongue out at #{@sailor}, and #{he} good naturedly cursed at #{his} captain before chasing the fleeing #{@sailor2}.
