      -- Mount Julia loomed up out of the ocean, a jagged peak that had been growing on the horizon all day. If the current wind held steady, the Lapis would arrive just after midnight – enough time for everyone to rest and catch their breath before exploring the city in the morning. A week of sailing had settled the crew into a comfortable routine. #{g.crew[0]} preferred the night shift, watching the helm while the captain slept, and #{g.crew[1]} was a natural in the rigging, scurrying up and down the masts to adjust the lines.
