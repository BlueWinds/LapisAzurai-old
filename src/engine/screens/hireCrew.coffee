      <p>Natalie talked with several sailors, but most of them weren't exactly prime material - too old, too young, sickly or untrustworthy. If they were just sailing around lakes, hauling cargo up rivers with a barge she might let them aboard anyway, but not on the open ocean. It was dangerous out there. Those terrible storms which made landfall, that tore houses from the ground and uprooted trees were nothing compared to the hurricanes that raged across open water. And the monsters. Always the monsters. Natalie had to trust her crewmates with her life.</p>
